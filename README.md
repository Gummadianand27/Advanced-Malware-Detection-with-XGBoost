# Microsoft Malware Detection

This project aims to identify and classify malware using various machine learning techniques. The project is based on a dataset provided by Kaggle as part of the [Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification).

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification)
- **Description**: The dataset consists of over 500 GB of malware samples, each represented as a series of hexadecimal values. The objective is to classify these samples into one of nine categories.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to develop a model that accurately predicts the category of malware for each sample. The steps included in this project are:

1. **Data Description**: Understanding the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
2. **Challenges Encountered**: Issues faced while working with the large dataset.
3. **Final Approach**: The strategy adopted to handle the dataset efficiently.
4. **Data Overview and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Insights into the data distribution, patterns, and relationships between features.
5. **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful features from the raw data.
6. **Modeling**: Building machine learning models using techniques like XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.
7. **Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using metrics such as log-loss and confusion matrix.
8. **Visualization**: Visualizing the data, model performance, and feature importance.

## Installation

To run this project, the following libraries are required:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost
```

## Usage

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/microsoft-malware-detection.git
cd microsoft-malware-detection
```

Open the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook MMD.ipynb
```

Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Results

The model's performance is primarily evaluated using multi-class log-loss, a metric that penalizes incorrect class probabilities. The best model in this notebook achieved a test log loss of 0.0070458 using XGBoost.
